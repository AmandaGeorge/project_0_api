#Microblog Project
- I will be creating a microblog where people can write really short public blog posts.  The homepage will show a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one.

##The project includes:
- Concepts: User Stories, OOP
- Tools: Underscore, Bootstrap, jQuery, Git, Kanban Board
- Object Types: Post

2. Make your basic user narrative, schema drawing, and Kanban board. These are required!

3. Start by creating a basic project and push to a public repo. Make frequent commits and pushes (every hour or so). Include a very, VERY short README.md that outlines what your app does and the libraries you are using.

4. Make your initial layout. Use default Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS.

5. Make a list of posts using Underscore.js templating and jQuery (and Object Oriented Programming!).

6. Make a form to add new posts to the list using Underscore.js templating and jQuery.

7. Be sure to comment your code, and make the code clean (mind spacing and indentation).
